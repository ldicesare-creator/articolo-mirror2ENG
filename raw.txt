______________________________________________________________________________

After my first article on GEO, I received dozens of messages and calls, from managers, recruiters, consultants.
All curious, many enthusiastic, some a little confused.
And almost everyone, at some point in the conversation, said the same thing:
“We’ve activated ChatGPT Enterprise for everyone. Or Copilot. Or Gemini. And now we’re figuring out how to use it.”
That has become the new mantra of corporate AI adoption: create enterprise accounts, distribute them, and hope something smart happens.

But it doesn’t happen.
At least, not in the way it should.

Let’s be clear: AI isn’t a platform, it’s a socio-technical system.
Without strategic direction, vision, governance, and shared goals, it becomes just another interface.
A few weeks ago, I completed the Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Business Strategy program at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and here I’d like to share some reflections that may sound familiar, or at least useful.

The Paradox of Top-Down Adoption
Over the past months, I’ve seen a recurring pattern: companies pushing AI from the top, but in a chaotic way.
Licenses bought in bulk, no integration plan, no training.
The implicit goal seems to be “don’t fall behind.”
But in the rush to look modern, many have forgotten to ask why.
As MIT professor David Autor reminds us, “the measure of a technology isn’t how fast or cheap it is, but how transformative.”

AI doesn’t exist to help us do what we already do, only faster. It exists to make us capable of doing what was previously impossible.
Too often, though, organizations confuse technology adoption with organizational transformation, two concepts that couldn’t be more different.

As Thomas Malone of MIT Sloan writes, “Most organizations today are far less intelligent than they could be.”

And simply adding a layer of AI won’t change that.

We need to build collective intelligence, people, data, processes, and machines that learn and reason together.

That’s precisely what MIT researchers Isabella Loaiza and Roberto Rigobon describe as the EPOCH capabilities: Empathy, Presence, Opinion, Creativity, and Hope, the human qualities AI can’t replicate and that, if cultivated, become a competitive advantage in any intelligent transformation.
Without them, AI becomes just an amplifier of disorganization.
I want to stress this point: organized collaboration between humans and machines can bring enormous benefits to both companies and people, but only if it’s implemented with awareness, inside a clear strategy that puts business needs and people’s growth at the center.

Two Underestimated Risks
What can happen when AI is adopted in an unstructured, or worse, chaotic, way inside organizations?
What happens when policies, accountability, and oversight are missing?
Here are two examples that I’m sure will sound familiar to many.

1) Workslop
As Harvard Business Review defined it, workslop is what happens when technology, instead of simplifying work, creates more of it.
It’s widespread in companies that adopt AI with no governance: you receive an email, a report, a PowerPoint deck that looks perfect, until you read it and realize something’s off.
You double-check data and sources, find errors, and end up redoing it from scratch.
On one side, someone produces things faster. On the other, someone else spends twice as long reviewing and correcting them.

Result: more chaos.

AI was supposed to save us time; in many organizations, it’s simply giving it back in the form of structured confusion.

2) Cognitive Dilution
This second risk is subtler, but possibly more dangerous: working with AI creates immediate efficiency, but it reduces memory and awareness.
Projects, emails, presentations, everything gets done faster, but less is retained.
When we delegate too much, we stop learning. And when we stop learning, we stop growing, as individuals and as organizations.
If you establish learning loops, the opposite happens: performance rises.
A study cited by Autor, conducted by MIT researchers Shakked Noy and Whitney Zhang, showed that ChatGPT not only accelerates work but “makes less-skilled workers perform more like highly skilled ones.”
It’s a clear example of how, used consciously, AI can close skill gaps instead of widening them.
But to achieve that, we need continuous feedback and learning system, otherwise productivity rises while knowledge thins out.

Practical Antidotes (3 moves):
•	Two-pass review: first generation, then human rewrite in five bullet points.
•	AI log: for every output, record the final prompt, sources, and three editing decisions made by humans.
•	Teach-back: whoever delivers the work explains, in 90 seconds, what they’ve learned, not just what they’ve produced.

That’s how the human-AI system truly thinks, perceives, acts, and learns.
If either side stops learning, the balance breaks, and we create hyper-active yet hypo-cognitive organizations.

The Governance Void
The solution isn’t just technical, it’s managerial.
Talking with recruiters, I often hear the same line: “Almost no company is hiring anyone to manage AI adoption. Only consulting firms are.”
The result? A governance vacuum.
No AI Owner, no Chief AI Officer, no cross-functional committee to guide adoption.
Everyone works “by tool,” not “by objective.”
The predictable outcomes: overlapping initiatives, inconsistent output, data-security risks, zero accountability.

As the MIT course phrased it, “Collections of people and computers will be smarter than either alone.”
But only if someone orchestrates the collaboration.
Without clear rules, every prompt becomes an undeclared corporate policy.
Every company should establish a governance taskforce to define, implement, and supervise AI initiatives, a steering group at the highest level:
CEO → goals & budget
Head of AI → roadmap & quality
CTO → security & integration
Head of HR → upskilling & policy
Head of Legal → risk, audit, privacy
An additional risk, highlighted by MIT Sloan professor Kate Kellogg, is delegating AI adoption to the youngest employees simply because they’re “digital natives.”
Research shows that, without senior oversight that understands both the logic of the systems and their organizational impact, AI tends to be managed with novice tactics: lots of enthusiasm, little strategy.
That’s why executive endorsement is more critical than ever.

From Chaos to Method: A Five-Step Framework
To move beyond this chaotic phase, we need method, a clear, progressive, adaptable framework.
What follows is an operational synthesis inspired by MIT Sloan’s approach, simplified for real-world contexts, even outside tech.
1.	Purpose, Define the Why
Why adopt AI? To reduce costs, improve service, free up time, innovate models?
Without a shared “why,” every license is a blind investment.
2.	People, Engage and Educate
AI isn’t (only) for IT. We need broad literacy and internal AI Champions who bridge technology and business.
As Nick van der Meulen (MIT CISR) reminds us, skills are dynamic: what makes you effective today won’t be enough in five years.
AI requires continuous learning and horizontal career paths, more of a lattice than a ladder, where people move, experiment, and cross-pollinate ideas.
3.	Process, Choose the Right Starting Points
Don’t start from the tool, start from the process.
Identify repetitive, low-value activities where AI can have an immediate impact.
But frame adoption within a long-term roadmap aligned with real business needs: innovation only matters when it serves the mission.
4.	Platform, Build on Solid Foundations
Interoperable infrastructures, API-first, security by design, and above all, strong data management.
AI shouldn’t be an add-on, but a connective layer across systems. Only then does it become a multiplier, not another silo.
5.	Policy, Govern and Measure
Define clear rules on ethics, privacy, and accountability.
Establish who can do what with AI and how impacts are evaluated.
Governance isn’t bureaucracy, it’s freedom with boundaries.

From Method to Practice: A Simple Case
To see how this framework works in practice, let’s start with a simple, real example: electronic invoice management.
It’s a repetitive, well-documented administrative process, perfect for intelligent automation.
In many organizations, invoice routing and validation still require dozens of human hours per week.
Each document must be classified (supplier, expense type, cost center, urgency), checked, and sent to the right approver, high-effort, low-value work.
With an AI-driven approach, you can train a supervised machine-learning model on historical data, thousands of standardized XML invoices already labeled by cost center and approval path, and automate the entire flow: reading, classification, routing, and validation.
Applying the framework:
•	Purpose: cut processing time and errors, freeing resources for higher-value work.
•	People: involve Finance and IT from day one, with an internal AI Champion overseeing data quality.
•	Process: start with the most standard sub-process (recurring-service invoices), then expand.
•	Platform: integrate the ML model with the ERP and an RPA system for execution.
•	Policy: define who can validate exceptions, how errors are handled, and how accuracy is measured.
Outcomes (typical range):
– 60% reduction in average processing time
– 40% reduction in classification errors
and a clear improvement in traceability and compliance.
It’s a small example but it proves the point: you don’t need a moonshot, just a clear process, clean data, and a measurable strategy.

Conclusion, AI Isn’t an Upgrade, It’s an Organizational Project
AI adoption isn’t an IT project.
It’s an organizational project.

Rolling out enterprise accounts doesn’t mean you’re ready; it only means you’ve paid the entry fee.
The real work starts afterward: building processes, roles, and metrics that make AI part of the culture, not just the infrastructure.

In the decade ahead, the most intelligent organizations won’t be those with more models, but those with more method.
Because, and I say this with the conviction built over years of experience and study, AI on its own will never make unintelligent companies smart.
But it can massively accelerate those that learn how to be.
